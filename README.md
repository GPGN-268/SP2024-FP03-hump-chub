## Short 1-2 sentence summary
We aim to compare population and size data for the Humpback Chub to precipitation in the Colorado River basin.

## Some introductory background information
The Humpback Chub is a native species of fish of the Colorado River Basin, protected under theEndangered Species Act due to the effects of dams and human water use on river flow & habitat

## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)

As climate change affects weather patterns across the globe, annual precipitation is expected to change as well. Stories of water shortages and long term droughts already fill headlines as reservoirs hit historic lows. The two largest reservoirs in the world, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are fed by the Colorado River Basin, with the effects of long term droughts already impacting the millions of people that depend on its water. Other creatures also depend on the Colorado River Basin for survival, notably species of fish like the humpback chub that are only found in the Colorado River. Federally protected and classified as endangered, the chub has seen rapidly declining populations since the building of dams on the Colorado River in the 1970s. This raises the question: how will the humpback chub respond to a changing climate? More particularly, will the population change and will growth be affected by a change in precipitation? We will compare population size and average chub length to precipitation in the Colorado River Basin with the goal of understanding how the chub will respond to climate change.

## Tools/packages

Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
XML Workbook converters

## Planned methodology/approach

**Data Collection**:
	Humpback chub population sizes
    Average chub length
    Historical precipitation data for Colorado River Basin

**Data Cleaning and Prep**:
    Format conversions, especially for historical data, for compatibility
    Remove inconsistencies, outliers
    Remove irrelevant data used for other research

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
	Use descriptive functions to understand size/breadth of datasets
    Use histograms, scatter plots, time series plots to visualize datasets
    *Statistical Analysis*: Correlation analysis, regression analysis (maybe), understand the strength of relationship
		C. B. YACKULIC ET AL
            Closed models, which assume population closure during the study
            Open models to allow for gains and losses to the local population over the period of data collection
	
**Modeling**:
		Predictive models to forecast Humpback Chub population dynamics based on precip. data
        Time series analysis, regression models, machine learning algorithms for complex relationships
	
**Validation/Interpretation**:
		Validation scores of models are optimized
		Identify potential mechanisms for driving observed patterns

## Expected outcomes
### Present or anticipated challenges:
Using files in the format of XML Workbooks
Historical data for precipitation, but much smaller time series for humpback chub data

## Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
